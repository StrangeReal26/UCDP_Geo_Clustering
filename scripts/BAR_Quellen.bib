	abstract = {This Primer presents the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP), a leading source of systematic information on armed conflict globally. UCDP data are used across numerous disciplines in the social sciences, natural sciences, and medicine to analyze conflict causes, climate change impacts, human health and environmental consequences, and much more. The UCDP collects geo-referenced event data on three types of organized violence: state-based conflicts, non-state conflicts, and one-sided violence. This Primer describes the content of UCDP’s core conflict data, the definitions, and the types of source materials used to collect the data. It also highlights key constraints and limitations of conflict event data collection, including challenges with information dissemination, censorship, and the handling of uncertainty in source materials. Furthermore, it describes the UCDP Conflict Encyclopedia, an online tool with interactive maps, graphs, and textual information about conflicts, actors, and conflict-affected countries. Finally, it provides some practical advice on how to use and access UCDP data.},

The implementation is developed as a new feature of the Java machine learning library Tribuo. This implementation leverages concurrency and achieves better performance than the reference Java implementation. Tribuo Hdbscan provides prediction functionality, which is a novel technique to make fast predictions for unseen data points using an HDBSCAN* clustering model. Tribuo Hdbscan cluster results and performance measurements are also compared with the state-of-the-art HDBSCAN* implementation, the Python module hdbscan.},

	abstract = {This chapter will discuss the unsupervised machine learning technique known as clustering and its main approaches and use cases. After presenting typical application areas for the tourism industry, the mathematical principle of clustering will be explained. Various techniques for representing differences between cases or clusters will be introduced, and major methods used to form clusters based on these differences will be presented (i.e., single linkage, complete linkage, average linkage, and centroid). Subsequently, the three most widely applied clustering approaches will be described. First, major concepts of hierarchical clustering, like divisive and agglomerative techniques, will be highlighted. Second, the partitioning technique k-means will be introduced, and, third, DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) will be discussed. By using real tourism data and the data science platform RapidMiner, the practical demonstration will then explain step-by-step how clustering approaches can be executed. After employing typical processes for data transformation and normalization, RapidMiner processes for k-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN will be shown, and the clustering results will be discussed. Lastly, a tourism case applying k-means and DBSCAN to identify points of interest based on uploaded photo data extracted from the platform Flickr will conclude the chapter.},

	abstract = {Fast technology development in recent years has led to a rapid increase in data generation. Most of the data are raw and need to be classified and processed into clean, usable data. However, classifying a huge volume of data is not an easy task, and it requires massive human efforts to label the data. To assist humans and shorten this labelling process time, data clustering is one of the most used methods in the first step of data cleaning. Among popular data clustering algorithms, Hierarchical Clustering is one of the best that can help to separate noise to recognize data patterns. In this paper, we conducted intensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of Hierarchical Clustering on multiple datasets using Apache Spark. We evaluated Hierarchical Clustering by comparing its performance in different sizes. Their volumes are provided in the experiment section.},
